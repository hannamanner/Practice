# goofery
So I'm now making this a makeshift journal so you can keep up with my progress.

## Oct 9 2022
I started "2022 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python" on Udemy. Lots of practice files about to show up! Tried to also figure out Jupyter today with jupyter_1.0.ipynb.

In any case, for future goofery there's amazingstuff.py that I've hardly touched, helloworld.py in which I created a basic dialogue program and the .gitignore document that I have zero idea on how it works. Will keep updating and creating further content as I learn more!
